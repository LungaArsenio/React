 * Axios let us create custom instances for API request.
 * Each instance is a separate client that an carry its own configuration and options
 * like baseURLs, timeouts, and headers.
 * Then we can reuse the configuration for API calls usng the same instance.
 *
 * The axios.create() function creates a new Axios instance.
 * The reason why are created instances is to set custom defaults
 * for your application.
