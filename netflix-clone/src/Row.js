/**
 * States is basically the way to write variables in react
 *
 * Asynchronous functions are functions that don't run right away because they make request
 * to third-party services and it take some time to process.
 *
 * .get is basically apending this "fetchUrl" to the actual link
 *
 * @LINE31
 * That line of code works because we created a prop that is set to true,
 * and we put it to add a class "row_posterLarge" if the return of the function
 * were true. Since we are using AND Operator (&&) it will return true because our prop "isLargeRow"
 * is set to true.
 *
 * It works because in JavaScript, true && expression always evaluates to expression
 * and false && expression always evaluates to false . Therefore, if the condition is true
 * the element right after && will appear in the output. If it is false , React will ignore and skip it.
